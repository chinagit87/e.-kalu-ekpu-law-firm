    <h5 class="corporate-h5">INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LAW</h5>
    <p class="certificate-pee">In today’s global economy, more companies either have established operations 
           on foreign soil or have business relationships with <br>customers, vendors or other third 
           parties located in other countries.
           <br><br>
           Unfortunately, disputes related to international business dealings are a common 
           occurrence. When they arise, it is important to choose <br>an established law firm with the depth of 
           knowledge and resources to effectively resolve the dispute.
           <br><br>
           At E. Kalu Ekpu Law, our skilled attorneys understand the nuances and challenges these 
           types of disputes can present and are adept at <br>handling high-value multi-jurisdictional 
           matters.
    </p>
    <h5 class="corporate-h5">AN EXPERIENCED RESOURCE TO HANDLE INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES</h5>
    <p class="certificate-pee">Resolving international business disputes favorably requires knowledge of various 
           domestic and foreign laws, as well as an understanding <br>of those countries’ cultural practices 
           and legal systems.
           <br><br>
           We help clients navigate these unfamiliar waters with ease, providing dedicated 
           service and a fierce commitment to protecting clients’ <br>interests and rights.
    </p>
    <h5 class="corporate-h5">A TAILORED APPROACH TO MEET EACH CASE’S UNIQUE CHALLENGESs</h5>
    <p class="certificate-pee">Companies entering into international contracts must comply with not only their 
           state’s laws and federal business laws; they must also ensure <br>agreements meet the legal 
           and practical requirements of the foreign jurisdictions in which they’re meant to apply. Failing 
           to follow required <br>laws can land businesses in hot water; this holds true for settling disputes 
           about international contracts and agreements too.
           <br><br>
           The international commercial law attorneys at E. KALU EKPU Law help global business clients settle 
           disputes through many international arbitration <br>forums, as well as through 
           litigation when necessary.
    </p>
    <h5 class="corporate-h5">INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION</h5>
    <p class="certificate-pee">In many international disputes, resolving the matter through arbitration can 
           be more cost-effective and expeditious. Our attorneys are familiar <br> with various forums and tribunals 
           for trans-national disputes, and we work closely with our clients’ internal legal departments (if applicable)
           to <br>determine the most appropriate forum for alternative dispute resolution.
    </p>
    <h5 class="corporate-h5">INTERNATIONAL LITIGATION</h5>
    <p class="certificate-pee">When litigating an international business dispute, our attorneys work to obtain 
           a positive outcome – one that helps protect our client’s rights <br>in a 
           legally enforceable way. We do this by identifying potential jurisdictional issues 
           up front, so we can fight for jurisdiction in the location we <br>believe is best. We also do everything in our power 
           to help our clients recover judgments they win in international commercial litigation cases.
    <h5 class="corporate-h5">CHOOSE E. KALU EKPU LAW FIRM FOR INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LEGAL NEEDS</h5>
    <p class="certificate-pee">There is no room for error when your business needs to initiate legal action 
           against or defend against a claim brought by, a party in a foreign <br> country.
           <br><br>  
           We are proud to provide the same services as large, international firms, but 
           with the customized feel and personalized attention offered by a <br>boutique-sized firm.

           each client achieve the best <br>possible outcome for their case.

          disputes.
