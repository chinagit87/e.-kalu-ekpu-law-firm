  <h5 class="corporate-h5">BUILDNG YOUR BUSINESS... IS OUR BUSINESS</h5>
  <p class="second-pee"><span>Business Agreements</span></p>
  <p class="certificate-pee">When business disputes arise, the underlying issues often relate to terms
     or provisions contained in legal agreements or contracts. <br> One of the best 
     ways to avoid problems later is by ensuring any agreement you enter into is both fair and legal.
     <br><br>
     When you work with one of the skilled business agreements attorneys at E. Kalu Ekpu 
     law, you can be confident that your agreements <br>are designed to meet your needs while 
     protecting your legal rights in Federal Courts, as well as international tribunals if your business 
     <br> will cross international borders.
  </p>
  <h5 class="corporate-h5">ASSISTANCE WITH A VARIETY OF CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS</h5>
  <p class="certificate-pee">Our experienced lawyers can help your business with a variety of legal agreements, 
     including business licensing agreements, partnership <br>and joint venture agreements, strategic alliance 
     agreements, financing agreements, non-disclosure agreements, confidentiality agreements, <br> 
     non-compete and non-solicitation agreements, technology-related agreements, and more.
     <br><br>
     Using “boilerplate” or off-the-shelf agreements might save your business money 
     up-front. However, when those agreements aren’t tailored <br> to meet your business’ 
     specific needs and aren’t drafted and reviewed by attorneys familiar with the specific laws and 
     regulations that govern <br> your business, you risk facing significant cost, hassle, and regulatory scrutiny later.
  </p>
  <h5 class="corporate-h5">AGREEMENTS FOR YOUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS</h5>
  <p class="certificate-pee">The specific types of agreements your business needs will largely 
     depend on your industry, the products, and services you offer, and how you <br> 
     conduct business.
      <br><br>
     E. Kalu Ekpu law can help you with business licensing agreements, agreements that will 
     govern strategic business relationships such as partnership <br> and joint 
     ventures, contracts to cover the technologies you use and much more.
  </p>
  <h5 class="corporate-h5">AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND VENDORS</h5>
  <p class="certificate-pee">The agreements you enter into with the employees, independent contractors and 
    vendors are also important.
    <br><br>
    Non-disclosure agreements (NDA) and confidentiality agreements can protect your 
    non-public business information, helping you get and maintain <br>a competitive edge.
    <br><br>
    Similarly, having employees and independent contractors sign non-compete or 
    non-solicitation agreements can ensure you don’t lose that competitive <br> edge because of 
    an employee’s decision to leave your organization.
  </p>    
  <h5 class="corporate-h5">AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND VENDORS.</h5>
  <p class="certificate-pee">No attorney or law firm can guarantee that a contract is 
    ironclad and will never result in future litigation. However, when you are deliberate 
    about hiring <br>an experienced contract and business law attorney to represent your 
    interests, you stand a much better chance of avoiding future disputes and commercial 
    <br>lawsuits.
    <br><br>
    The attorneys at E. Kalu Ekpu law understand how nuances or ambiguities in your 
    contracts and agreements can help – or hurt – you. We work closely with <br> 
    business clients to help negotiate contracts designed to truly protect our 
    clients’ interests and rights. We can professionally draft new agreements 
    for your <br> business or review and advise on agreements you’re being asked to sign 
    by others.
