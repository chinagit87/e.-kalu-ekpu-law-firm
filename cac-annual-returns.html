    <p class="certificate-pee"> CAC annual returns are mandatory yearly filings that all entities 
        registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in Nigeria <br> must submit to 
        confirm they are still active and to provide updated information about their operations 
        and structure. 
    </p>
    <h5 class="corporate-h5">CAC Annual Returns:</h5> 
  <div class="certificate-pee">
   <ul>
     <li  class="second-pee"> <span>Mandatory Requirement:</span> Filing annual returns is a legal obligation 
          under the Companies and Allied Matters Act <br>(CAMA) 2020 for all registered entities, 
          including business names, private and public limited companies, and incorporated 
          <br>trustees (NGOs, churches, etc.).
     </li> 
          <br>
     <li  class="second-pee"> <span>Purpose:</span> The primary purpose is to keep the CAC informed that the 
          business is still active and operating, maintain accurate <br> public records, and ensure 
          legal compliance. It is not the same as filing tax returns with the Federal Inland 
          Revenue Service <br>(FIRS).
     </li>
          <br>
     <li  class="second-pee"> <span>Required Information:</span> The filing requires updated details, such as 
          the registered name and address, particulars of directors/ <br>proprietors and share
          holders/partners, share capital, and sometimes financial statements (for companies) 
          or a statement of <br> affairs (for small companies).
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="corporate-h5">Filing Deadlines:</h5> 
      <ul class="certificate-pee">
        <li class="second-pee"><span>Business Names:</span> Annually, between January 1st and June 30th of each 
           year (except the year of registration).
        </li>
        <li class="second-pee"><span>Limited Liability Companies:</span> Must file within 42 days after their Annual General 
           Meeting (AGM), or for companies incorporated <br>after CAMA 2020, within 60 days of 
           the anniversary of their incorporation.
        </li>
        <li class="second-pee"><span>Incorporated Trustees:</span> After the first 12 months of incorporation, 
            and annually thereafter, typically by June 30th.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="corporate-h5">Consequences of Non-Compliance:</h5> 
      <p class="certificate-pee">Failure to file on time attracts penalties and fines for each year 
           of default. Consistent failure can lead to the company's status being marked as <br> "inactive" and eventually struck off the CAC register, meaning it loses 
           its legal existence and cannot access post-incorporation services, such as <br> obtaining CAC 
           documents or making changes to business particulars.
