  <h5 class="corporate-h5">BUILDNG YOUR BUSINESS... IS OUR BUSINESS</h5>
  <p class="corporate-p">Business Agreements</p>
  <p class="second-pee">When business disputes arise, the underlying issues often relate to terms or 
     provisions contained in legal agreements or contracts. One of the best ways <br><br><br> to avoid problems later 
     is by ensuring any agreement you enter into is both fair and legal.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="second-pee">When you work with one of the skilled business agreements attorneys at E. Kalu Ekpu 
     law, you can be confident that your agreements are designed to <br><br><br> meet your needs while 
     protecting your legal rights in Federal Courts, as well as international tribunals if your business 
     will cross international borders.
  </p>
      <br>
  <h5 class="corporate-h5">ASSISTANCE WITH A VARIETY OF CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS</h5>
  <p class="second-pee">Our experienced lawyers can help your business with a variety of legal agreements, 
      including business licensing agreements, partnership and joint venture <br><br><br> agreements, strategic alliance 
      agreements, financing agreements, non-disclosure agreements, confidentiality agreements, non-compete 
      and non-solicitation <br><br><br> agreements, technology-related agreements, and more.
  </p>
      <br>
  <p class="second-pee">Using “boilerplate” or off-the-shelf agreements might save your business money 
     up-front. However, when those agreements aren’t tailored to meet your <br><br><br> business’ 
     specific needs and aren’t drafted and reviewed by attorneys familiar with the specific laws and 
     regulations that govern your business, you risk facing <br><br><br> significant cost, hassle, and regulatory scrutiny later.
  </p>
      <br>
  <h5 class="corporate-h5">AGREEMENTS FOR YOUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS</h5>
  <p class="second-pee">The specific types of agreements your business needs will largely depend on your 
     industry, the products, and services you offer, and how you conduct business.
  </p>
      <br>
  <p class="second-pee">E. Kalu Ekpu law can help you with business licensing agreements, agreements that will 
     govern strategic business relationships such as partnership and joint <br><br><br> ventures, contracts 
     to cover the technologies you use and much more.
  </p>
      <br>
  <h5 class="corporate-h5">AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND VENDORS</h5>
  <p class="second-pee">The agreements you enter into with the employees, independent contractors and 
     vendors are also important.
  </p>
      <br>
  <p class="second-pee">Non-disclosure agreements (NDA) and confidentiality agreements can protect 
        your non-public business information, helping you get and maintain a competitive <br><br><br> edge.
  </p>
  <p class="second-pee">Similarly, having employees and independent contractors sign non-compete or 
    non-solicitation agreements can ensure you don’t lose that competitive edge <br><br><br>because of 
    an employee’s decision to leave your organization.
  </p>
  
    <br>
  <h5 class="corporate-h5">AGREEMENTS WITH EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND VENDORS</h5>
  <p class="second-pee">No attorney or law firm can guarantee that a contract is ironclad and will 
    never result in future litigation. However, when you are deliberate about hiring an experienced 
    <br><br><br>contract and business law attorney to represent your interests, you stand a much better 
    chance of avoiding future disputes and commercial lawsuits.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="second-pee">The attorneys at E. Kalu Ekpu law understand how nuances or ambiguities in your 
    contracts and agreements can help – or hurt – you. We work closely with business <br><br><br> clients to help 
    negotiate contracts designed to truly protect our clients’ interests and rights. We can professionally 
    draft new agreements for your business or review <br><br><br> and advise on agreements you’re being asked to sign 
    by others.
