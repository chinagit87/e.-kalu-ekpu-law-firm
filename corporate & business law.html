  <h5 class="corporate-h5">BUILDNG YOUR BUSINESS... IS OUR BUSINESS</h5>
  <p class="corporate-p">Business Formations and Start-Ups</p>
  <p class="certificate-pee">Choosing a type of business entity for your new business is a crucial 
      first step. Unfortunately, there is no “one size fits all” approach; <br>rather, the best entity 
      for your company will depend on a number of factors.
      <br><br>
      The corporate and business law attorneys at E. Kalu Ekpu Law firm can help 
      you evaluate your options, choosing an entity form and <br> helping you with other critical 
      start-up decisions that make sense based on where you are today. We’ll also work closely with you 
      to <br>make sure the strategies we recommend and implement consider your dreams and goals 
      for your business in the years to come.
  </p>
   <h5 class="corporate-h5">CHOOSING A BUSINESS ENTITY</h5>
   <p class="certificate-pee">Whether you choose to formally incorporate your new business, establish 
      a partnership or form a limited liability company, you need <br>to understand the
      implications of that decision.
      <br><br>
      C-corporations are a popular choice for many businesses that are trying to 
      attract venture capital and public funding because they can <br>have an unlimited 
      number of shareholders and are often perceived as being more professional 
      businesses. 
      <br><br>     
      However, anyone forming a C-corporation should also be aware that this type 
      of business requires corporate formalities including <br> maintaining bylaws, 
      holding board meetings and shareholder meetings. From a tax standpoint, 
      C-corporations are taxed as separate legal <br>entities, so both the corporation 
      and its founders/ shareholders pay taxes on income.
      <br><br>
      S-corporations may offer more favorable tax treatment for business owners. 
      However, there are some drawbacks too.
      <br><br>
      This type of business entity is limited to a maximum of 100 shareholders. 
      S-corporations allocate profits according to ownership interest, just <br>like
      with C-corporations. However, the partners of S-corporations are only taxed on 
      their personal income rather than also being taxed at the <br>corporate level.
      <br><br>
      Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) in offer owners the same liability protection 
      as corporations, but with fewer formalities. However, LLCs cannot <br>be public 
      entities and may not issue stock. This makes them a less attractive business 
      form for any business that wants to grow through external <br>investments.
      <br><br>
      Partnerships can be a good structure for some business owners who want the 
      liability protection afforded by corporations with pass-through tax <br>treatment. 
      However, just like LLCs, partnerships cannot “go public.”
    </p>
    <h5 class="corporate-h5">SERVICES FOR START-UP COMPANIES</h5>
    <p class="certificate-pee">Start-up businesses can face an uphill battle getting their business 
      up and running. In addition to helping determine which type of legal business <br>
